The "Permission denied (publickey)" error usually happens when the SSH server on the Raspberry Pi is configured to only accept specific authentication methods, and password authentication might be disabled.

Here are a few steps to troubleshoot and resolve this:

1. **Verify SSH Access**  
   Try manually logging into the Raspberry Pi with the command:
   ```bash
   ssh aadish@192.168.70.63
   ```
   If it prompts for a password, SSH access should be available, and we can proceed with `ssh-copy-id`. If you still get a "Permission denied" error, make sure:
   - The `sshd` server on the Raspberry Pi is configured to allow password-based authentication.
   - You’re using the correct username (`aadish`) and IP address.

2. **Check SSH Configuration on Raspberry Pi**  
   If you have another way to access the Raspberry Pi (such as connecting a monitor and keyboard directly):
   - Open the SSH configuration file on the Pi:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
     ```
   - Make sure these settings are configured as follows:
     ```plaintext
     PubkeyAuthentication yes
     PasswordAuthentication yes
     ```
   - Save the changes, then restart the SSH service:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl restart ssh
     ```

3. **Manually Copy the Key**  
   If `ssh-copy-id` still doesn’t work, you can manually copy the public key:
   - Copy your public key to the clipboard:
     ```bash
     cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
     ```
   - On the Raspberry Pi, open (or create) the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file:
     ```bash
     nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
     ```
   - Paste the key into this file, save, and close. Make sure the permissions on the `~/.ssh` folder and `authorized_keys` file are correct:
     ```bash
     chmod 700 ~/.ssh
     chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
     ```

After trying these steps, you should be able to connect using SSH with your key.
